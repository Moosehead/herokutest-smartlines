        <h1>Edge Betting</h1>
        <p>An edge is a measure of the advantage you hold on a particular wager. If you had the chance to wager $10 on a coin flip, winning $20 for a heads but losing your $10 on a tails, you would have no real advantage over the coin flipper. This is because the value of the payout is completely proportionate to the probability of getting heads.</p>

        <p>There is no advantage to this wager, since we are just as likely to make money as we are to lose it. If, however, we were paid $21 for a heads instead of $20, everything changes. Half of the time we will lose $10, but the other half the time we will make $21; it is not difficult to see why this would be an attractive wager. We are now being paid 2.1 to 1 for an outcome we will hit 50% of the time. In this instance, our edge would be calculated as:</p>

        <div class="+flex +flex-direction-column">
          <span>Edge = (Probability of Heads x Odds) - 1</span>
          <span>= (50% x 2.1) - 1</span>
          <span>= 5%</span>
        </div>

        <p>When we are making wagers with a positive edge, we are far more likely to be profitable in the long run than with wagers that carry a negative edge.</p>
        <p>Common odds offered by bookmakers for an outcome they believe has a 50% chance of success is 1.91 (or -110 in American odds). This is a far less attractive wager than even the even odds we were offered in the beginning. It becomes increasingly clear that if we were to flip a coin indefinitely offering only $19.10 for each success, the coin flipper would eventually walk away with pockets full of our hard earned money.</p>
        <p>For a 50% outcome offering 1.91 odds, our edge is -4.5%, indicating that unless we have some reason to believe that the odds of success are truly greater than 50%, we will certainly lose money in the long run.</p>
        <p>Pursuing positive edge bets is not the only valid or successful betting strategy, but it is a proven method to significantly increase your likelihood of being a profitable sports bettor.
